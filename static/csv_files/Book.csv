"According to iOS developer guide, Each call to this method is always preceded by a call to the tableView:dragSessionWillBegin: method. 
Did we implement tableView:dragSessionWillBegin: too? Also the logic to maintain the boolean variable ""needToLoadDraggedCell"" is not clear. On which tableview delegate methods we need to set the variable's value. How did you figure out this. What if we need to add a new tableview delegate? At that time, what should be the value of ""needToLoadDraggedCell""? Also, did you check, if cellForRowAtIndexPath is calling after each drag and drop without your change?
Lastly, is the issue root cause is properly identified?",Organization
"Q. Did we implement tableView:dragSessionWillBegin: too?
Ans: No, we are not implementing this method because we have nothing to do during drag session began.If we implement then it will be called before.

Q. is the issue root cause is properly identified?
Ans: Before we need to know our problem scenario, that is when we drag a cell and scrolling down so that dragged cell's position is gone up, on that case the preview was not shown but if we again scrolling up with the dragged cell to it's previous position the preview is shown. When we leave the dragged cell during the case of not showing preview, the dragged cell is not updated and this is the issue.
Now the preview showing is handled by iOS. So we can not control it.  

Q.How did you figure out where ""needToLoadDraggedCell"" should be set?
Ans: For resolving this issue we need to update the specific dragged cell during the occurrence of this issue at the end of the drag session.

dragPreviewParametersForRowAtIndexPath this method is called when we drag the cell and leave the cell at a place where we will not drop it (if it is implemented ).
moveRowAtIndexPath is called when we successfully drop a cell.

After this two methods tableView:dragSessionDidEnd this method called.So we are setting false in this two methods. If the issue situation occur dragPreviewParametersForRowAtIndexPath this method will not be called so on that case we update the cell in tableView:dragSessionDidEnd method.",Organization
